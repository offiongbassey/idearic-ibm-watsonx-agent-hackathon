  3. Develop **A. Full Business Plan** with the following sections:

     - **Impact & Vision**: Long-term vision and societal impact.
     - **Funding Ask**: Exact amount requested, breakdown of use of funds, and expected runway.

  4. Develop **B. Entire 10-slide Pitch Deck Outline**:
     1. **Cover Slide**: Startup name, tagline, and visual hook.
     2. **Problem**: Use a relatable real-world founder/designer scenario.
     3. **Solution**: Explain product, include IBM Watsonx/AI-powered matching feature.
     4. **Product Demo / UX Flow**: Step-by-step journey from project posting to completion.

     6. **Business Model**: Show revenue math visually.
     7. **Competitive Landscape & Advantage**: Table comparing features vs. competitors.

     9. **Traction / Pilot Plan**: Early user numbers, waitlist signups, pilot results.
     10. **Impact, Vision & Ask**: Long-term vision, funding request, and exact use of funds.

     - **Concise but impactful**.
     - **Slide-ready** (bullet points, short sentences, not paragraphs).

     - Written to inspire hackathon judges.

  6. Never stop output mid-way. Deliver both the full plan and the pitch deck in every response.
